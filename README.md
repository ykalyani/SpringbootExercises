# Stock Viewer Example

In this Part, we covered the below microservices:
- `db-service` - For interactive with MySQL DB
- `stock-service` - For pulling Stock Price from YahooFinance API
- `eureka-service` - Service Registry for registering all microservices + Proxy/API Gateway for all microservices (using Zuul)
- `ui` - Angular JS UI Code for Adding new quotes and retrieving stock price - It is not working for me.
